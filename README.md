## How It Works
This project is a simple web application that uses a JavaScript program to generate random crypto currency names and short names. The program selects a combinations of names from an array of names and composes them into a resulting random name. To make changes in how the web application looks change index.html and style.css. To make changes in how the web app creates a random name, change script.js.
